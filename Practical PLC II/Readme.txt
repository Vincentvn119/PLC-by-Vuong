These are the projects I  wrote from scratch when taking the course of Practical PLC Programming II with Paul Lynn on Udemy.
In each folder, you will find:
1, Project setup and requirements : P &ID, flows and testing criteria
2, The ladder logix I deveploped and test with RSLogix 500

My thought: 
-There are 10 Practical PLC projects in this course and all are very challenging to me. 
-The two projects I like most are Project 4 and Project 10:
+ Project 4 was about controlling a conveyer belt of a nuts filling station using proximity sensors, colors sensor, radar sensors, actuators, and motors. 
+ Project 10 was about protecting and controlling an expensive pump with a flow sensor and pressure sensor and alarm notification.

Information about this course ( copied from Udemy):

What youâ€™ll learn:
- By the end of this course, you will be both able and practiced at originating complex ladder logic applications.

- The primary and overall objective of this course is to give an INTERMEDIATE PLC programming student, rigorous, practical experience in creating unguided, 
original ladder logic.

- Students will build on the knowledge and understanding of PLC programming they got from "PLC Programming from Scratch" by using those instructions 
and environments and techniques to create real-world solutions to problems defined throughout this course.
- Upon completion of this course, students will have the requisite skill set to translate a description of a process into a functioning logical solution.

-This is the course the acclimates you to the real world.  This isn't the classroom anymore; this is war!  You vs the PLC.

About this course: 

-In this course, we hit the ground RUNNING. I designed this course to build upon the theoretical training students received in "PLC Programming from Scratch" by taking 
that knowledge (plus a few new pieces) and constructing original ladder logic applications to solve everyday, industrial problems.

-Using the Rockwell software RSLogix 500, RSLinx and RSLogix 500 Emulate, you will be given various descriptions / specifications for programs 
and then expected to write each one from scratch.  After, I will walk everybody through my own approach to each problem step-by-step.  
Lastly, we'll run each project on the emulator and debug as required before moving on to the next section.

-This course is 100% practical!  It is expected and assumed that you got the theoretical in my previous PLC course, and as such, this course contains NO REFRESHERS. 
This is all new material!  There ARE a few new instructions used in this course, and those will be properly introduced, 
but you should already know how to use blocks like XIC, XIO, OTE, ONS, SCP, JSR and etc..  Again - this is an INTERMEDIATE course. 
It has a PREREQUISITE course before it.  Don't try to walk before you crawl and then get all sour and mad about it when you fall down.  

- Let me be clear: you WILL struggle in this course.  That's the whole point.  
My first PLC course has a lot of group hugs, hand-holding, warm bottles of milk and hippie drum circles all in a safe, friendly, positive learning environment.  
This course is NOT like that.  This is boot camp.  This is you being thrown into the deep end of the swimming pool... with a shark. 
 If you want to get frustrated, wrack your brain trying to solve hard problems and learn what it's like being a PLC programmer - this is your course! 
 You'll come out of it better, faster and smarter.  If you're not ready for that yet, take my first course.
